							department since its very inception. 
							</br><br>TECSTASY a quest for knowledge and is an endeavor to build a center stage for sharing knowledge and learning among various academic insti</br>tutions 
							across India. The participants form a rich mix of graduate and post  -  graduate students from leading educational institutes.
							</br><br><!--Tecstasy team is committed to provide an extraordinary perspective for educating the next generation of engineers in India. --

							<br><br>This time our Technical symposium includes the following :
							<ul>
								
								<li><b>Cognos :</b>The paper presentation event, is one of the elite events of tecstasy, giving a platform for the opportunity seekers to present their ideas.<br>
								<li><b>Code-a-thon:</b> Each Team will have to choose a problem statement to which they will be working on a solution. This involves 2 days(approx 30hrs) of hard coding . The solution can be in the form of a Web/Progressive Web/Android App. Later, each team should give a presentation on their work.<br>
								<li><b>Web kooks :</b>An event to showcase your User Interface (UI), along with a Powerpoint presentation<br>
								<li><b>Smart Coding:</b> A coding competition where contestants are trapped in a room for a certain amount of time in which they will be given a mix of logical reasoning and programming based questions to solve.<br>
								<li><b>Tech Hunt :</b> It is an event where you need to hunt your brains for logic behind the code and solve them by using previous code.Reach the maximum possible stage of the treasure hunt before time runs out.<br>
								<li><b>Word feud :</b>Collect the pieces of clues given to you and solve the crossword before the clock ticks away. You will be given an empty crossword puzzle which must be filled with the answers to the questions, which are usually the pre-defined programming language keywords and methods.<br>
								<li><b>Bug hunter:</b> Bug Hunter is a debugging event in which you can discover the debugger in you. Don't wait until you have a bug to step through your code.<br>
